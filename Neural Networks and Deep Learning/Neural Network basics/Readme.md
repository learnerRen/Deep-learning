This is the second week "Neural Network Basics" (1-2)course for the second part of the neural network and deep learning(www.deeplearning.ai).
Package:
- numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. 
- h5py is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file. 
- matplotlib is a famous library to plot graphs in Python. 
- PIL and scipy are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end.
As far as I am concerned, Anaconda which covers a lot of scientific packages, and it is easy for us to manage our packages, even python of different versions is a good choose.
